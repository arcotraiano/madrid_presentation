However, not all patients are able to take advantage of the positive effects of PCC. Inadequate health literacy (HL) is an important limiting factor in the ability of patients to take on an active role and exchange information with their health care provider effectively. A provenly effective approach to improvement of provider-patient interaction and health outcomes is the use of health-related questionnaires. The aim of the research project described within this thesis was to adapt the most frequently-used questionnaire in Dutch physical therapy practice and add information and communication technology to it. A Dutch and Turkish version of the tool called Talking Touch Screen Questionnaire (TTSQ) was developed and evaluated on both usability and validity aspects. The current prototype of the tool does not yet fully solve the problems native and minority patients with low (health) literacy have with completing the adapted questionnaire. Big challenges in future development and testing the TTSQ are the recruitment of vulnerable members of the hard-to-reach native and minority target populations and finding research methods that suit the abilities and needs of these participants. This is expected to be a very challenging, labor- and time-consuming process. On the other hand, having a usable, valid and reliable TTSQ may well save a lot of time and money in both research and clinical practice in the future.']</td>

The 21st century, western citizens of the world travel more often, with more comfort, and longer distances than ever. History shows that a growing economy leads to a growing human need for communication and mobility. The daily action space of people exceeds by far the borders of their own city or village. The Network City is a reality. The essence of the (practical) field of urban design and planning concerns the making of plans in behalf of the vitality of urban areas. The vitality of todayÃ¢â¬â¢s city is endangered most (reasoned from the perspective of mobility) by: 1 the (direct, but especially indirect) space consumption of infrastructures and vehicles; 2 the decrease of accessibility of urban areas; 3 the absence of coherence between the hierarchical levels in the urban network. It is widely agreed among urban experts that the new urban technologies, among others transport technologies, play a major role in (the development and transformation of) todayÃ¢â¬â¢s socio-spatial environment. But it is still quite unclear how these new technologies should be interpreted in terms of the planning and design of the Network City. The main objective of this research is to generate those kinds of guidelines and recommendations for the planning and design of the Network City, all from a mobility point of view. In general terms, this thesis focuses on the mutual relation between city functioning and transport systems. More specifically, it focuses on the case studies of collective demand-responsive transport, and the location choice (process) of transfer points.']</td>

Chromosomal errors in the embryo are the single most common cause whereas uterine factors are invariably invoked to explain non-chromosomal miscarriages. These uterine factors are, however, poorly defined. The ability of a conceptus to implant in the endometrium is normally restricted to a few days in the menstrual cycle. A limited ‘window of implantation’ ensures coordinated embryonic and endometrial development, thereby minimizing the risk of late implantation of compromised embryos. In this thesis we investigate the emerging evidence indicating that RPL is associated with impaired differentiation of endometrial stromal cells into specialized decidual cells. From a functional perspective, this differentiation process, termed decidualization, is not only critical for placental development but also signals the end of the implantation window and bestows on the endometrium the ability to recognize, respond to and eliminate implanting compromised embryos. Thus, we propose that spontaneous decidualization of the human endometrium, which inevitably causes menstrual shedding in the absence of a viable conceptus, serves as functional “window for natural embryo selection”. Conversely, impaired decidualization predisposes to late implantation, negates embryo quality control, and causes early placental failure, regardless of the embryonic karyotype. This pathological pathway also explains the common observation that many RPL patients seem exceptionally fertile, often conceiving within one or two cycles. Thus, as the clinical correlate of inappropriate uterine receptivity, ‘superfertility’ should be considered as a genuine reproductive disorder that requires targeted intervention.']</td>

As the demand for the development and optimization of large-scale systems is growing, so does the need for better techniques to understand their underlying dynamic behavior and predict and manage their long-term performance. With the increased capabilities of computer technology, we have been able to run simulation models for these systems that are larger in scale and higher in complexity. While these advancements have enabled more accurate representations of real-world systems, the ever-increasing scale and complexity of simulation models may eventually result in models that are too complex to work with – giving rise to large-scale complex simulation models. In this dissertation, we aim to investigate to what extent the abstraction of large-scale complex simulation models, specifically discrete- event simulation models expressed in the DEVS formalism, can be automated using their state- trace data. In order to achieve this objective, we designed a method that integrates the fields of modeling and simulation and temporal data mining by utilizing state-trace data and applying frequent episode mining techniques to discover behavioral patterns.']</td>

This work is particularly focused on the production of furfural from hemicellulose-derived pentoses. The possibility of producing materials, chemicals, and fuels from biomass has a long history. Unfortunately fossil resources, in particular oil, have dominated last century both in the chemical and energy sectors due to their enormous availability at relatively low cost. Nowadays, bio-based chemicals and fuels are gaining a much more favorable competitive position, not only by virtue of high oil prices and the forecasts on their future availability, but also because of the increasing public environmental awareness. Although the use of biomass for energy, and in particular for biofuels production, has been greatly challenged recently in terms of real benefits to the environment, the technological advances in the biorefinery field offer many reasons to believe that, in the near future, biomass could be definitely the sustainable alternative to fossil resources in the chemical and also fuels industries. By a careful review of the scientific literature, and observing the recent research trends, it is noticeable that a relatively short list of high-potential biomass-derived building blocks has the potential for replacing or substituting fossil resources in nearly every industrial field. The broad family of furan compounds represents certainly an intriguing selection of biomass derivatives for many industrial applications. Furfural is nowadays the only starting material for the production of nearly all the furan compounds. Furfural industry exists since almost a century, but it is nowadays facing a major renovation challenge in order to meet the global trend toward bio-based products, and the consequent increased demand for furfural and its derivatives. The majority of current furfural production is still based on more or less modified versions of the original Quaker Oats process (1921). For reasons that can be related to their limited technological evolution, the production processes in use today generally suffer from low yields (around 50%), besides significant economical and environmental concerns. All these reasons hindered the expansion and modernization of the furfural industry below its actual potential. A profound technological development is a priority in order to upgrade furfural to a large-volume bio-based commodity. The integrated production of furfural within modern biorefineries is a big opportunity, and it will most probably represent the next cornerstone in the development of furfural industry. In Chapter 1 the opportunities offered by the modern biorefinery in the broader context, and the importance of furan compounds are highlighted. In this context the enormous potential of furfural and its derivatives, both in the chemical and energy sector, is discussed. Recent advances in furfural technology are summarized, both regarding furfural synthesis and applications, eventually stating the motivation behind this dissertation, and the main achievements herein contained. In Chapter 2 the experimental methods used in this work are carefully described. A new lab-scale titanium reactor was built in order to investigate several aspects related to the furfural formation and related reactions, and to enable liquid phase reactions under a relatively broad range of pressure, temperature and pH conditions. This test rig has allowed most of the experimental work behind this dissertation, and thus it is thoroughly described in this chapter in all the relevant aspects typical of chemical reactor engineering. The analytical and experimental methods employed in the several experimental campaigns described in this dissertation are also extensively described. Chapter 3 concerns the reaction kinetics of furfural formation. Even considering the number of relevant works on the topic of furfural formation in acidic media, a general expression for the reaction kinetics, its dependence on the acid nature and concentration, and the potential effect of other species present in solution, is yet to be defined. Results of reaction kinetics studies related to furfural formation from xylose, xylose side reactions, and furfural destruction in acidic aqueous media are thus studied and reported. In Chapter 4 some particular aspects of the chemistry of xylose reaction into furfural are addressed with the aim to clarify the reaction mechanism and to define new green catalytic pathways for its production. Specifically the reduction of mineral acids utilization is addressed by the introduction of alternative catalysts. In this sense the effect of chloride salts in dilute acidic solutions at temperatures between 170 and 200 °C is described. Results indicate the Cl? ions to promote the formation of the 1,2-enediol from the acyclic form of xylose, and thus the subsequent acid catalysed dehydration to furfural. For this reason the presence of Cl? ions led to significant improvements with respect to the H2SO4 base case. The addition of NaCl to a 50mM HCl aqueous solution (0.18 wt%) allows to attain 90% selectivity to furfural. Among the salts tested FeCl3 shows very interesting preliminary results, producing exceptionally high xylose reaction rates. Starting from the results discussed in chapter 4 on the effects of Cl? ions on furfural formation in aqueous acid solution, the general effect of different halides is addressed in Chapter 5. Experimental results show the halides to influence at least two distinct steps in the reaction leading from xylose to furfural under acidic conditions, via different mechanisms. The nucleophilicity of the halides appears to be critical for the dehydration, but not for the initial enolization reaction. By combining different halides synergic effects become evident resulting in very high selectivities and furfural yields. In Chapter 6 the combined production of hemicellulose-derived carbohydrates and an upgraded solid residue from wheat straw using a dilute-acid pretreatment at mild temperature is described. Dilute aqueous HCl solutions were studied at temperatures of 100 and 120 °C, and they were compared to dilute FeCl3 under the same conditions. Comparable yields of soluble sugars and acetic acid were obtained, affording an almost complete removal of pentoses when using 200mM aqueous solutions at 120 °C. The solid residues of pretreatment were characterized showing a preserved crystallinity of the cellulose, and a almost complete removal of ash forming matter other than Si. Results showed upgraded characteristic of the residues for thermal conversion applications compared to the untreated wheat straw. Chapter 7 deals with the industrial processes for the production of furfural, describing in particular an innovative process patented by Delft University of Technology and based on the results contained in this dissertation. As already mentioned, the integrated production of furfural within modern biorefineries will most probably represent the next cornerstone in the development of furfural industry. The innovative process concept described in this chapter is aimed at an economically viable and environmentally sound furfural production, with reduced energy and chemicals consumption. The evaluation of process economics shows encouraging results compared to existing processes, making this concept economically attractive. Finally, in Chapter 8 main concluding remarks are provided, as well as recommendations for future research.']</td>

Analyses of molecular data gave strong evidence for dividing placental (eutherian) mammals into four major groups. One of these groups, Afrotheria, includes morphologically very distinct mammals such as elephants, sea cows, hyraxes, aardvarks, elephant shrews and two endemic African insectivores: tenrecs and golden moles. Inclusion of golden moles and tenrecs in Afrotheria leads to the conclusion that the present order Insectivora should be divided into two groups, one with African origin and one with Laurasian origin. These two groups of insectivores have originated and evolved independently, showing remarkable parallel adaptive radiations at the morphological level. Most notable are the morphological convergences of Erinaceidae (hedgehogs) versus Echinops (Madagascar 'hedgehogs'); Soricidae (shrews) versus Microgale (shrewlike tenrecs); and Talpidae (moles) versus Chrysochloridae (golden moles). Further, molecular clock estimations suggested that the radiation of the different Afrotheria, which all have African origin, occurred during Africa's isolation in mid Cretaceous to early Cenozoic. In conclusion, a well resolved eutherian tree has been obtained, which displays new and surprising relationships which have never been recognized by morphological or paleontological data"]</td>
